# Crafting Interpreters using F# (WIP)
This is a repo of me working through the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html),
using [F#](https://fsharp.org/).

## Goals
 * Learn about compilers and interpreters
 * Get better at F#
 * Implement as much of Lox as possible using F# and .Net including the VM
 
 ## No instructions yet
 I am still early in the book and don't have anything really functional.
 Will update this as I progress.
